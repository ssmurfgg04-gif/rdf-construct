# Changelog

All notable changes to rdf-construct will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

**If you run `order` without `-o`, your output moves.** The default output
directory is now `ordered/` instead of `src/ontology/`. Pass `-o src/ontology`
to keep the previous location.

**If you consume single-page JSON output, the filename changed.**
`docs --format json --single-page` now writes `index.json`, the name the guide
always documented, instead of `ontology.json`.

### Changed
- **`order` defaults `-o/--outdir` to `ordered/`, not `src/ontology/`** (#128).
  `src/` is a Python packaging convention that says nothing about ordered RDF,
  and the old default silently created a two-level tree wherever the command
  happened to be run. `ordered/` names what it holds, matching `uml` →
  `diagrams/`, `docs` → `docs/` and `split` → `modules/`. An explicit `-o` is
  unaffected, and `-o src/ontology` restores the previous behaviour.
- **`docs --format json --single-page` writes `index.json`, not `ontology.json`** (#258).
  The single-page branch picked its own filename while the guide, including its
  own worked example, documented `index.json`. Both modes now use the documented
  name, so a consumer can open `index.json` without knowing which mode produced
  the directory. The schema is unchanged.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-04

Completes the `docs` entity-type taxonomy carried over from v0.5.0, and fixes
much of the output around it: links that resolved from the wrong place, entity
filtering that was honoured by page generation but not by links, non-reproducible
search output, and a badge palette in which four of twelve colours failed WCAG AA
contrast.

**If you consume the JSON output, two arrays have moved.** `skos:Concept` and
`skos:ConceptScheme` subjects leave `instances` for top-level `concepts` and
`concept_schemes`; properties whose kind the source does not state leave it for
`other_properties`. Both are described below, and both mirror what v0.5.0 did for
shapes.

**If you publish generated HTML, ten of the twelve badge colours have changed.**
The palette was re-derived as a set so that all of them clear WCAG AA — four did
not — and so that no two are closer than 5.3 CIEDE2000 units under simulated
colour-vision deficiency. Only the class and shape badges keep their previous
values. Regenerated documentation will look different.

**If you run `order` with a hand-written profile, check your selector names.** A
section whose `select:` names something that cannot be resolved now fails the run
instead of silently emitting a file with that section missing. A profile that has
been quietly producing short output will start reporting it.

Everything else is additive.

### Added
- **First-class SKOS support in the `docs` command** (#63). `skos:Concept` and
  `skos:ConceptScheme` are now rendered as a distinct entity type alongside
  Classes, Properties, Instances and Shapes, in HTML, Markdown and JSON output:
  - Concepts and schemes get their own pages under `concepts/`, sharing the
    directory and distinguished by kind badges (`skos concept`,
    `skos concept scheme`) — the arrangement NodeShapes and PropertyShapes
    already have in `shapes/`
  - Labels are grouped **by language**: one row per language tag carrying
    `skos:prefLabel`, `skos:altLabel` and `skos:hiddenLabel` together, rather
    than rendering as duplicate triples
  - All **seven** SKOS documentation properties render with their language
    tags — `skos:definition`, `skos:scopeNote`, `skos:example`, `skos:note`,
    `skos:historyNote`, `skos:editorialNote` and `skos:changeNote` (the
    seventh is beyond the six the issue listed, but the SKOS spec defines it
    alongside them and it was already being collected)
  - `skos:broader` / `skos:narrower` render as a tree on the scheme page and
    as inline cross-links on each concept page. **`skos:broader` is not
    treated as `rdfs:subClassOf`** — nothing is inherited along it; the tree
    is a navigation aid
  - `skos:broader`/`skos:narrower` are materialised **in both directions**,
    since SKOS declares them inverses, so a vocabulary that asserts only one
    direction documents the same hierarchy. `skos:related` is treated as
    symmetric and `skos:topConceptOf` as implying `skos:inScheme`, which it is
    a sub-property of
  - **Cyclic `skos:broader` is tolerated.** SKOS does not promise acyclicity:
    the tree walker never expands a concept twice on one path, and any concept
    a cycle leaves unreachable from a root is promoted to a root rather than
    silently dropped
  - `skos:inScheme` membership renders on both sides — the concept links to
    its scheme, the scheme lists its members. A concept in **no** scheme is
    still documented
  - Mappings (`skos:exactMatch` and friends) and any other predicate get a
    visible key-value fallback rather than being dropped
  - Search index entries cover concepts and schemes, indexing alternative and
    hidden labels across all languages — hidden labels exist to catch
    misspellings, which is exactly what a search index is for
  - New `--no-skos` flag; `concepts` accepted in `--include` / `--exclude`;
    new `include_skos` config key. One toggle covers both SKOS kinds
  - `skos:Collection`, `skos:OrderedCollection` and SKOS-XL are deferred —
    no real-world material in the test set exercises them
- New `EntityKind` members `SKOS_CONCEPT` and `SKOS_CONCEPT_SCHEME`, and new
  `ConceptInfo`, `ConceptSchemeInfo`, `ConceptNode`, `LabelGroup` and
  `NoteValue` dataclasses, all exported from `rdf_construct.docs` along with
  `build_concept_tree()`
- New tracked SKOS test fixture (`tests/fixtures/docs/skos_vocabulary.ttl`).
  The repository previously contained no `skos:Concept`, `skos:ConceptScheme`,
  `skos:broader`, `skos:narrower` or `skos:inScheme` at all, so there was
  nothing to demonstrate the feature against. It deliberately includes a
  `skos:broader` cycle, which is why it is a fixture rather than a shipped
  example
- SKOS badge colours, chosen against measured figures rather than by eye:
  `skos_concept` `#1d4ed8` (6.70:1 against white) and `skos_concept_scheme`
  `#1e3a8a` (10.36:1), both clearing WCAG AA for normal text. The indigo
  family originally proposed was rejected on measurement — it sits 11.3
  CIEDE2000 units from the existing object-property violet (10.7 under
  simulated deuteranopia); blue keeps 15.3 / 17.7 / 21.3 (normal /
  deuteranopia / protanopia). Its weakest axis is tritanopia at 6.0 against
  the instance emerald, where the badge's text label carries the category
- **`owl:NamedIndividual` surfaced as a distinct kind** (#64). An entity
  explicitly typed `owl:NamedIndividual` now carries a `named individual`
  badge in HTML and Markdown, and `"named_individual"` in its `kinds` array
  in JSON:
  - This is a refinement on an entity's existing kinds, **not** a new
    bucket. Named individuals stay where they were routed — an individual
    under `instances/`, a SKOS concept under `concepts/`, a NodeShape under
    `shapes/`. No new directory, no new top-level JSON array, no CLI flag,
    and nothing breaking
  - The badge shows whenever the declaration is **asserted**, including when
    it is redundant in OWL DL terms (an entity that already has a class
    typing). `kinds` records what the source says rather than what a
    reasoner could infer, consistently with every other kind — and the
    redundancy is itself information: it says the author was explicit
  - An entity typed *only* `owl:NamedIndividual`, with no class typing at
    all, is documented as an instance carrying the kind — that declaration
    is the only thing marking it as an individual
  - No false positives: an entity typed only by its class carries just
    `["instance"]`. Classes and properties never gain the kind
  - Searchable — the kind joins the entity's search keywords, so a literal
    search for `named_individual` finds them. The search `entity_type` is
    unchanged, so named individuals are not a separate search bucket
  - `rdfs:Datatype` and `owl:DeprecatedClass` / `owl:DeprecatedProperty`
    remain out of scope. Deprecation is orthogonal to entity kind and needs
    its own design
- **Deprecated terms are now marked in `docs` output** (#108). A term the
  source marks deprecated carries a visible marker — an outlined badge beside
  its kind badge in HTML, a `> **Deprecated.**` banner on Markdown pages, a
  `deprecated` boolean in JSON, and a `deprecated` search keyword. Previously
  the only trace was a row in the annotations table, next to `seeAlso`:
  - **Both OWL mechanisms are recognised** — an `rdf:type` of
    `owl:DeprecatedClass` / `owl:DeprecatedProperty`, and the `owl:deprecated`
    annotation. Real ontologies use either or both, and before this the type
    form produced no trace at all
  - **The annotation is read by value, not presence.** `owl:deprecated false`
    is legal and means the opposite; truthiness alone gets it backwards,
    because an untyped `"false"` literal is a non-empty string
  - **Deprecation is orthogonal to entity kind**, so it is a marker rather
    than an `EntityKind` member: a class, any property, an instance, a SKOS
    concept and a SHACL shape can each be deprecated, and each keeps its own
    kind badge. Nothing changes bucket
  - **It does not propagate** — a property whose domain is a deprecated class
    is not itself marked, and nor are the subclasses of one
  - The badge is an outline rather than a fill, so it composes with a kind
    badge instead of competing with one, and needs no slot in the kind palette
  - Deprecated terms are still documented; hiding them behind a flag needs
    per-entity link handling rather than the per-type `--include` / `--exclude`
    machinery, so it is deferred
- New `EntityKind` member `NAMED_INDIVIDUAL`, and a new tracked fixture
  (`tests/fixtures/docs/named_individuals.ttl`) — the repository previously
  contained no `owl:NamedIndividual` in any RDF file
- Named-individual badge colour `#047857`, 5.48:1 against white (clears
  WCAG AA), a deeper emerald than the `#10b981` instance badge it sits
  beside so the two read as one family — 21.7 CIEDE2000 units apart in
  normal vision, 15.3 under simulated deuteranopia

### Changed
- **Breaking (JSON output):** `skos:Concept` and `skos:ConceptScheme` subjects
  have left the `instances` array for new top-level `concepts` and
  `concept_schemes` arrays, mirroring what v0.5.0 did for shapes. The
  `statistics` block gains `concepts` and `concept_schemes` counts. Consumers
  reading `instances` for SKOS entities must read the new arrays
- A subject typed both `skos:Concept` and `owl:Class` (or a property, or a
  SHACL shape) keeps its existing page and does not gain a second one: classes,
  properties and shapes outrank SKOS in routing. It remains listed as a member
  of its scheme, cross-linked to the page it does have

### Fixed
- **Markdown cross-references now resolve from the page that contains them**
  (#87, contributed by @tasodoufu). Entity links were emitted as a path from
  the docs root regardless of where the page sat, so from `classes/Dog.md` a
  link to `Mammal` read `classes/Mammal.md` and resolved as
  `classes/classes/Mammal.md` — broken in GitHub's blob view, in MkDocs and in
  any local previewer. The renderer now threads the page being written through
  to the link helper, as the HTML renderer has done since #59. Two follow-ons
  landed with it:
  - `render_concept` and `render_concept_scheme` set the current page too.
    Without it the SKOS pages inherited whatever rendered last, which happened
    to be the right depth when instances were present and one level too high
    when they were not — 38 wrong-depth links under `--no-instances`
  - Link extensions are stated rather than derived from `config.format`, whose
    map knows `"markdown"` but not the `"md"` alias `DocsGenerator` accepts.
    Under that alias the files were written `.md` while every link pointed at
    `.html`
  A Markdown link walk now covers all of it — the counterpart of the HTML walk
  that has caught this class of bug since #60, and whose absence is a fair part
  of why #87 lasted as long as it did
- **Every entity-kind badge now clears WCAG AA contrast** (#106). Four failed
  outright — `annotation` 2.15:1, `datatype` 2.43:1, `instance` 2.54:1 and
  `object` 4.23:1, against badge text that is 12px bold and so needs 4.5:1,
  not 3.0:1. The closest pair in the palette was also 2.1 CIEDE2000 units
  apart, below the ~2.3 just-noticeable difference:
  - The palette was **re-derived as a set**, not patched colour by colour,
    because darkening one badge to pass moves it toward its neighbours.
    Chosen by constrained search: maximise the smallest pairwise distance
    across normal vision and simulated deuteranopia, protanopia and
    tritanopia, subject to the contrast floor, to each family keeping its hue,
    and to the derived kind staying the darker of its pair. Worst pair is now
    **5.3**, lowest contrast **4.71:1**
  - **Hue identity is preserved wherever a badge has shipped** — classes stay
    blue, object properties violet, datatypes cyan, annotations amber,
    instances emerald, shapes red-rose. Only the shade moves
  - **SKOS moves from blue to fuchsia.** It collided with the Class badge,
    which has always been blue via `--primary-colour`; SKOS arrived in this
    unreleased version, so no user has ever seen it and the move costs nothing
  - The **Class badge was missing from the original inventory** — it carries
    no kind class and falls through to `--primary-colour`, so it was invisible
    to a survey of `.entity-type.*` rules. It passes at 5.17:1 and is unchanged
  - A test now reads the stylesheet the renderer emits and fails if any badge
    drops below AA, so a kind added later cannot ship unchecked
- **`order` now fails on a section whose `select:` names a selector nothing can
  resolve** (#89), instead of selecting nothing and saying nothing. The section
  simply vanished from the output — the same failure shape as #84 one level
  down: there a *profile* claimed nothing, here a *section* did. Worse, the
  unclaimed-subjects warning added in #88 then misdiagnosed it, telling the user
  to "add a section with `select: obj_props`" when their profile had exactly
  that section, misspelled. The run now exits 2, names the profile and the
  section, and lists both the built-in selector keys and the ones the config
  defines. Two spellings are affected: a key that resolves to nothing at all,
  and a key defined in `selectors:` whose *value* is not one this version
  recognises
- **The shipped `templates/ordering_starter.yml` now runs.** It defines each
  selector as a YAML list, and selector resolution called `.strip()` on the
  value — so the template the documentation tells users to copy exited 1 with an
  `AttributeError` traceback. Non-string values no longer crash: a built-in key
  dispatches on its name regardless, and anything unresolvable gets the
  actionable error above. Found while fixing #89, on the same line
- **`--include` / `--exclude` are now honoured by links, not just by page
  generation** (#115). Filtering decided what was *generated* and nothing
  decided what was *linked to*, so excluding an entity type filled the output
  with links to pages that were never written. The workflow DOCS_GUIDE
  advertises as "only classes" produced **43 dead links** in HTML. Two causes,
  both fixed:
  - Four of the six index sections checked their config flag — the ones added
    in #60, #63 and #76 — and the older Classes, Object Properties and
    Datatype Properties sections did not. Same split in the Markdown index,
    and in the index statistics cards
  - Entity pages cross-linked to excluded entities. A class page linked to its
    properties with no guard, which is why `--exclude properties` broke every
    class page while `--exclude instances` broke nothing: the Instances section
    of that same template was already guarded
  A reference to an excluded entity is now rendered **unlinked but still
  visible** (`ex:hasPart` in code formatting) rather than dropped — a document
  that filtered properties out of the *documentation* must not imply the class
  has no properties. Output with default configuration is byte-identical
- **Single-page Markdown no longer links to pages it never writes** (#113).
  `--format markdown --single-page` produces exactly one file, but rendered
  cross-references as links to each entity's own page — `concepts/Dwelling.md`,
  `classes/Person.md` — every one of them dead. Both the SKOS section and the
  Shapes section were affected; the latter since v0.5.0. References now render
  as the entity's qname in code formatting, which stays greppable within the
  single document and matches what the HTML single-page template already did.
  Multi-page Markdown output is unchanged, byte for byte
- **`docs` output is now byte-reproducible between runs** (#107). Keyword lists
  in `search.json` were built with `list(set(...))`, and Python randomises
  string hashing per process, so two runs over identical input produced a
  different key order every time — for every entity kind. Regenerating a
  committed docs site showed a diff with no semantic change, and the project's
  own verification technique (generate output at two commits and diff it) could
  not be used on this command without pinning `PYTHONHASHSEED`. Keyword order
  has never been meaningful to `search.js`, which substring-matches over the
  whole list
- **The search overlay now works on every page, not just the three at the docs
  root** (#86). `assets/search.js` made two root-relative assumptions that the
  #59 fix did not reach, because that fix covered the Jinja templates only:
  - It fetched `search.json` page-relatively, so from `classes/Dog.html` the
    browser requested `classes/search.json`, got a 404, and the index never
    loaded — typing in the box did nothing at all, with no error and no
    empty-results message. On `examples/animal_ontology.ttl` the index was
    unreachable from **16 of 19 pages**
  - It injected the index's root-relative result URLs verbatim as hrefs, so a
    result clicked from a sub-folder page resolved one level too deep —
    **256 broken (page, result) pairs** on the same corpus
  Both now resolve against a per-page `window.DOCS_ROOT`, set by
  `base.html.jinja` from the same `link_root` every other link already uses, so
  an explicit `base_url` keeps working unchanged
- **The search box now says why it is unavailable under `file://`** instead of
  rendering and silently doing nothing. `fetch` is CORS-blocked on `file://`
  whatever the path, so search genuinely cannot work from a double-clicked
  page; the input is disabled and explains itself
- **`docs` no longer misfiles properties declared only by an OWL characteristic**
  (#76). A term declared solely `owl:TransitiveProperty`, `owl:SymmetricProperty`,
  `owl:AsymmetricProperty`, `owl:ReflexiveProperty`, `owl:IrreflexiveProperty`
  or `owl:InverseFunctionalProperty` was extracted as a generic **instance** and
  documented as an individual — the extractor recognised only `owl:ObjectProperty`,
  `owl:DatatypeProperty`, `owl:AnnotationProperty` and `rdf:Property`. All six are
  subclasses of `owl:ObjectProperty` in OWL 2, so they are now documented as object
  properties. `owl:DeprecatedClass` had the same problem on the class side and is
  now documented as a class
- **Properties whose kind the source does not state now have somewhere to go.**
  `owl:FunctionalProperty` and `owl:DeprecatedProperty` are subclasses of
  `rdf:Property` only, so nothing says whether such a term is an object or a
  datatype property. These, and plain `rdf:Property` declarations, are documented
  under `properties/other/` with a neutral `rdf property` badge (`#334155`,
  10.35:1 against white), listed in an **Other Properties** section, and carried
  in a new top-level `other_properties` JSON array. `rdf:Property`-only terms
  previously got **no page at all**: they were extracted, routed to an unreachable
  `other/` directory and never rendered
- The `docs` extractor now takes its class and property type sets from
  `rdf_construct.core.vocab` rather than repeating shortened lists, so the sets
  cannot drift between commands again. The `order` command moved to them in v0.5.0
- New `include_other_properties` config key; `other_properties` accepted in
  `--include` / `--exclude`, and `properties` covers it

### Contributors
- Thanks to @tasodoufu for diagnosing and fixing #87, and for reviewing the
  follow-on commit that closed the two gaps `main` had opened underneath it

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added
- **First-class SHACL shape support in the `docs` command** (#60). NodeShapes
  (`sh:NodeShape`) and named PropertyShapes (`sh:PropertyShape` with their own
  URI) are now rendered as a distinct entity type alongside Classes, Properties,
  and Instances, in HTML, Markdown, and JSON output:
  - Each shape gets its own page under `shapes/`, with kind badges
    (`shape`, `node_shape`, `property_shape`) distinguishing NodeShapes from
    named PropertyShapes
  - The 21 most-used SHACL constraints (`sh:path`, `sh:minCount`, `sh:maxCount`,
    `sh:datatype`, `sh:class`, `sh:nodeKind`, `sh:in`, `sh:hasValue`,
    `sh:pattern`, `sh:minLength`, `sh:maxLength`, `sh:minInclusive`,
    `sh:maxInclusive`, `sh:targetClass`, `sh:targetNode`, `sh:targetSubjectsOf`,
    `sh:targetObjectsOf`, `sh:closed`, `sh:ignoredProperties`, `sh:name`,
    `sh:description`) get explicit per-format rendering; everything else
    (including `sh:severity`, `sh:order`, `sh:qualifiedValueShape`, etc.) falls
    back to a generic visible-but-plain key-value display rather than being
    silently dropped
  - Blank-node PropertyShapes attached to a NodeShape via `sh:property` render
    inline on the parent shape's page as a constraint table; named
    PropertyShapes get their own pages plus an inline reference + link from any
    NodeShape that uses them
  - `sh:targetClass`, `sh:path`, and references to named PropertyShapes resolve
    to clickable cross-references when the target is in the ontology, falling
    back to plain code-formatted URIs otherwise
  - Logical operators (`sh:and`, `sh:or`, `sh:xone`) and `sh:qualifiedValueShape`
    are deferred — they need their own design pass and will be handled in a
    future release
- **Multi-kind data model.** Entities now carry a `kinds` list of
  `EntityKind` enum members. Default values: `[CLASS]` for classes,
  `[PROPERTY, <type>_PROPERTY]` for properties, `[INSTANCE]` for instances,
  and `[SHAPE, NODE_SHAPE]` / `[SHAPE, PROPERTY_SHAPE]` for shapes. A NodeShape
  that is also typed `owl:NamedIndividual` is placed in the Shapes section
  rather than Instances, so it is documented once rather than twice. It does
  not yet carry a named-individual kind — there is no `NAMED_INDIVIDUAL` member
  in the enum, and recognising that type is stage 2/3 work. The `kinds` list is
  the extension point for it, and for SKOS support
- New `other_props` selector for properties whose kind is not implied by their declaration —
  `rdf:Property`, `owl:FunctionalProperty`, `owl:DeprecatedProperty`. These remain visible to
  the `individuals` selector, so existing profiles keep emitting them; adding an `other_props`
  section before `individuals` groups them instead
- New `rdf_construct.core.vocab` module holding the class and property type sets in one place,
  so consumers no longer reproduce (and shorten) the list
- New `EntityKind` enum (str-mixin) exported from `rdf_construct.docs`,
  centralising kind values. Members: `CLASS`, `PROPERTY`, `OBJECT_PROPERTY`,
  `DATATYPE_PROPERTY`, `ANNOTATION_PROPERTY`, `RDF_PROPERTY`, `INSTANCE`,
  `SHAPE`, `NODE_SHAPE`, `PROPERTY_SHAPE`. Compares equal to its string
  values and serialises to JSON as plain strings
- New `ShapeInfo` and `PropertyShapeInfo` dataclasses, exported from
  `rdf_construct.docs`. `ShapeInfo` covers NodeShapes and named PropertyShapes;
  `PropertyShapeInfo` covers individual property constraint blocks (whether
  blank-node arcs of a NodeShape or top-level constraint sets of a named
  PropertyShape)
- New `extract_all_shapes()` extractor and `extract_shape_info()` /
  `extract_property_shape_info()` helpers
- New `ExtractedEntities.shapes`, `node_shapes`, and `property_shapes` fields
  / computed properties
- New `DocsConfig.include_shapes` flag (default `True`) parallels
  `include_instances`. When `False`, shapes are excluded from the output
  pages and from the search index
- New `--no-shapes` CLI flag and `shapes` accepted in the `--include` /
  `--exclude` filter values
- New `shape.html.jinja` template; `shape` entity type added to
  `entity_to_path` / `entity_to_url` routing under `shapes/`
- CSS for shape badges in HTML output: `.entity-type.shape` (`#dc2626`,
  4.83:1 contrast), `.entity-type.node_shape` (`#b91c1c`, 6.47:1),
  `.entity-type.property_shape` (`#e11d48`, 4.70:1) — all WCAG AA against
  the badge's white text. Single hue family (red-rose) signals
  NodeShape/PropertyShape kinship; brightness gradient reads as
  parent-child. Distinct from the existing purple/cyan/amber/green
  badges under common colour-vision deficiencies; descriptive uppercase
  badge text labels (`"NODE SHAPE"`, `"PROPERTY SHAPE"`) carry the
  category meaning regardless of perceived colour
- `BaseRenderer.render_shape()` abstract method, implemented in all three
  renderers (HTML / Markdown / JSON)
- Comprehensive test coverage: 44 new tests in 7 classes covering shape
  extraction, multi-kind handling, all three renderers, JSON schema, search
  index integration, the `include_shapes` toggle, routing, and the
  `EntityKind` enum contract
- `order` profiles accept an `unclaimed` policy, in `defaults:` or on an individual
  profile, controlling what happens to subjects no section of the profile claims:
  `warn` (default) reports the loss on stderr and exits 0, `emit` appends them in a
  trailing section so nothing is lost, and `ignore` is silent — for a profile such as
  `test_profile.yml`'s `compact` that filters on purpose. The warning names the terms
  and the `select:` key that would have claimed them (#84)

### Changed
- **Breaking change to JSON output**: SHACL shapes used to appear in the
  `instances` array of `index.json` and `ontology.json` because the extractor
  didn't filter them out. They now have their own top-level `shapes` array,
  and shapes have been removed from `instances`. JSON consumers updating from
  v0.4.x must read both arrays to see all entities. The new top-level
  `shapes` array contains complete `ShapeInfo` JSON for each shape (single-page
  mode) or summary entries (index mode) — see `docs/user_guides/DOCS_GUIDE.md`
  for the full schema. The `statistics` object also gains a `shapes` count (#60)
- All entity entries in JSON output now include a `kinds` array carrying the
  full multi-kind list. Existing fields are unchanged. This is additive —
  consumers that ignore unknown fields are unaffected (#60)

### Fixed
- `rdf-construct --version` reports the version in the source rather than the one recorded
  in the installed distribution metadata. `@click.version_option()` with no argument
  resolves through `importlib.metadata`, so an editable install whose metadata predated a
  version bump reported the stale number — v0.4.0 for a v0.4.7 checkout — until someone
  re-ran `poetry install`. The same call also named the group function rather than the
  tool, printing `cli, version …`; it now prints `rdf-construct, version …` (#66)
- `order` no longer emits an empty `[ ]` in place of a blank node that no section
  claimed. `build_section_graph()` copies triples by subject, so an `owl:Restriction`
  or an `owl:unionOf` list lost its own triples while the reference to it survived —
  producing not a partial ontology but a different one, asserting an anonymous class
  with no axioms. Blank nodes reachable from the selected subjects are now pulled in
  transitively, whatever the `unclaimed` policy says: a blank node carries no identity
  a profile could select it *by*, so it belongs to the description of whatever
  references it (#84)
- `order` no longer silently drops subjects that no profile section claims. Copying the
  shipped `examples/order/sample_profile.yml` was enough to hit it: its `doc_order` and
  `props_by_domain` profiles had no `annotation_properties` section, so
  `animals:scientificName` and its three triples were absent from the output with no
  warning and exit code 0. Both those profiles — and the matching pair in
  `ies_profile.yml` — now have the missing section, and the default policy reports any
  remaining gap (#84)
- `order` no longer drops terms declared only as `rdf:Property`. They were excluded from the
  `individuals` selector while no other selector claimed them, so their triples were silently
  absent from the ordered output — 10 triples in, 8 out, with no warning
- Terms declared only by an OWL property characteristic (`owl:TransitiveProperty`,
  `owl:SymmetricProperty`, `owl:AsymmetricProperty`, `owl:ReflexiveProperty`,
  `owl:IrreflexiveProperty`, `owl:InverseFunctionalProperty`) are now selected as object
  properties rather than classified as individuals. Each is a subclass of `owl:ObjectProperty`
  in OWL 2, and declaring one alone is legal and common in older ontologies
- `owl:DeprecatedClass` is now recognised by the `classes` selector
- Quoted the CURIEs in the `together:` flow sequences of `examples/uml/uml_layouts.yml`. Unquoted
  `building:Building` inside `[ … ]` is rejected by stricter YAML parsers than the one this project
  uses, so the example failed to load for anyone whose toolchain is spec-conformant. The parsed
  data is unchanged
- `docs` no longer emits leading-slash paths (`/assets/style.css`, `/index.html`, …) for the
  stylesheet, the navigation tabs and the search script when `base_url` is unset. These
  resolved against the filesystem or web root rather than the docs directory, so the generated
  documentation was unstyled and unnavigable under `file://` and under any sub-path host
  (GitHub Pages project sites among them). The same root cause also broke entity-to-entity
  links from sub-folder pages, where a bare `classes/Animal.html` resolved as
  `classes/classes/Animal.html` — 62 of the 157 broken references in a 19-page sample. Layout
  assets and entity links are now resolved relative to the page being rendered (`./` at the
  root, `../` under `classes/` and `instances/`, `../../` under `properties/object/` and its
  siblings); an explicitly configured `base_url` still takes precedence and produces the same
  absolute URLs as before (#59)
- Fixed `_walk_rdf_list` and `extract_property_shape_info` silently truncating
  `rdf:List` members at the first cell when the list-rest pointer was a blank
  node (the rdflib default representation). In practice this meant `sh:in`
  constraints with multiple values lost everything except the first member
  during extraction. Both call sites now accept blank-node list pointers.
  Found while writing tests for #60

### Contributors
- Thanks to @otellomaria for reporting #59 with a clean reproducer
- Thanks to @algojogacor, @hyldmh and @mayank-dev-15, who each independently diagnosed the same
  root cause and proposed a fix for it in #67, #68, #70 and #71

**Note:** `docs` entity extraction has the same gap that `order`'s selectors had — a property
declared only by an OWL characteristic is missed. It is not addressed here and is tracked as #76.

**Note:** the #59 fix covers the generated HTML only. Two related defects with the same root cause
remain, both raised out of it: the search overlay is inert on any sub-folder page (#86), and the
Markdown renderer emits root-relative entity links (#87).

## [0.4.7] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- Fixed `lint --init` generating a malformed first line in the "Available rules" comment
  block: a stray `# ` prefix outside the f-string caused the first rule to render as
  `# #   - <rule>` while subsequent rules rendered correctly. Cosmetic only — the
  generated config remained valid YAML — but visually inconsistent (#58)

### Contributors
- Thanks to @otellomaria for their first contribution to rdf-construct

## [0.4.6] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Fixed `order` command emitting SPARQL-style `PREFIX` declarations instead of valid Turtle
  `@prefix … .` directives. Strictly conformant parsers (triple stores, validators, rdflib in
  strict mode) reject the `PREFIX` form, which is N3/SPARQL syntax not valid Turtle per the
  W3C spec (#56)

## [0.4.5] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- New documentation guide: `docs/user_guides/CAST_GUIDE.md` covering pipe mode, file output,
  format aliases, quad flattening, prefix binding behaviour, programmatic API, and examples

### Changed
- Updated `docs/user_guides/CLI_REFERENCE.md` with full `cast` command section (options, format
  aliases table, pipe mode note, examples, workflow snippet)
- Updated `docs/user_guides/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` — added `cast` to commands table, new Format
  Conversion section, output formats table, and Cast Guide link
- Updated `docs/user_guides/GETTING_STARTED.md` — command count 14 → 15, added Format
  conversion category with `cast` and `puml2rdf`, added cast to CI/CD pattern and Next Steps

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **New `cast` command** for converting an RDF file between serialisation formats (#53)
  - Accepts any format rdflib can parse: `ttl`, `turtle`, `n3`, `nt`, `ntriples`, `xml`, `rdf`,
    `rdfxml`, `json-ld`, `jsonld`, `trig`, `nq`, `nquads`
  - **Unix pipe-friendly**: a single `--format` flag writes RDF to stdout with all diagnostics
    routed to stderr — `rdf-construct cast ontology.ttl --format n3 | grep rdf:type` works as
    expected
  - Multiple `--format` flags write one output file per format to the output directory
  - Default output (no `--format`): converts to `ttl`, `xml`, and `json-ld`, excluding the
    source format
  - `--output-dir` overrides the output directory (default: same directory as source)
  - `--allow-flatten` merges all named graphs into the default graph when converting from a
    quad format (TriG, N-Quads) to a single-graph format; without this flag, such conversions
    are rejected with a clear error
  - Source format equal to target format: warns and skips without error
  - Exit codes: 0 (success), 1 (partial failure — some formats failed), 2 (complete failure)
- New module `src/rdf_construct/core/formats.py` — shared format utilities
  - `normalise_format()`: normalises format aliases (`"ttl"` → `"turtle"`, etc.)
  - `infer_format()`: infers rdflib format from file extension
  - `extension_for_format()`: returns preferred output extension for a canonical format
  - `is_quad_format()`: detects multi-graph formats (TriG, N-Quads)
  - `default_cast_formats()`: computes default output format set excluding source format
  - Exported from `rdf_construct.core` for use by other commands
- New module `src/rdf_construct/cast/` — programmatic conversion API
  - `CastConverter.convert()`: callable as a Python API independently of the CLI
  - `ConversionResult` dataclass with `success`, `partial_failure`, `written_files`,
    `stdout_content`, `warnings`, `failed_formats`, and `error` fields

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- Fixed `order` command expanding anonymous (implicit) blank nodes into separate top-level named stubs. Blank nodes with exactly one incoming arc are now serialised using Turtle's `[ … ]` inline syntax, preserving authorial intent and readability. Blank nodes referenced by more than one triple, or that are reification stubs, continue to be emitted as top-level `_:bN` subjects (#51)
- Fixed `format_term()` emitting bare rdflib internal identifiers (e.g. `Nff2ed53a…`) for stub blank nodes instead of the `_:id` form required by the Turtle grammar, which caused parse failures on round-trip

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- Fixed `order` command outputting extraneous prefix declarations (e.g. `brick:`, `csvw:`, `foaf:`, `odrl:`) that were not present in the source file. rdflib's `Graph()` auto-registers ~30 well-known namespace defaults; the serialiser now uses `bind_namespaces="none"` and explicitly binds only namespaces actually used in the output triples (#49)
- Fixed `collect_used_namespaces` not scanning `Literal.datatype` URIs, causing datatype namespaces like `xsd:` to be dropped from the output when no other terms used them
- Added `namespace_source` parameter to `collect_used_namespaces` to support scanning one graph's triples while matching against another graph's namespace registry

### Changed
- `build_section_graph` now creates its sub-graph with `bind_namespaces="none"` and binds only used namespaces from the base graph, ensuring clean prefix declarations in output

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- Fixed `lint` command crash with `AttributeError: 'TextFormatter' object has no attribute 'format_summary'` caused by import name collision between `rdf_construct.lint.get_formatter` and `rdf_construct.merge.get_formatter`
